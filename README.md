# basenote and basenote-exp

## Basenote
Half way between qwerty and Colemak

This should be a very effective crossover between qwerty and colemak.
Relatively easy to learn.
Only 12 letters change position from qwerty and most importantly it keeps qwerty's "S" in the same place and "D" on the same finger.


## Basenote exp.
An experiment that only changes 10 letters from qwerty and may work just as well or even better
