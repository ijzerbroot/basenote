Half way between qwerty and Colemak


![](https://github.com/ijzerbroot/basenote/blob/main/basenote.png)

This should be a very effective crossover between qwerty and colemak.
Relatively easy to learn.
Only 12 letters change position from qwerty and most importantly it keeps qwerty's "S" in the same place and "D" on the same finger.
